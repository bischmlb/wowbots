## WOW BOTS
This repository contains software consisting of a collection of bots for the game ```World of Warcraft```.   

### General information
The software is strictly used at own risk.   
If you do not have an account, the only way to currently get one, is to contact me privately, and intend for it to stay that way, to limit the spread of cheat software.  
If you are reading this file, it will most likely mean that the repository has been made open to public, and the code will be compressed or hidden, to avoid reproduction.  

### How to use
Running the files will lead you to a GUI with some BOT options. Simply choose the one you wish to run, and make sure the game is open. You *cannot* run any of the bots in the background - so run them in your away time from your machine. The bots are based on monitor scan and general I/O from your machine, and using the machines while running the bots will interfere with the processes.
